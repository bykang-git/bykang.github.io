Following the Dempster-Shafer theory (DST), numerous combination methods have been put forward to combine interval-valued belief structures (IBSs). Nevertheless, when most of these methods are utilized to handle highly conflicting IBSs, they still lead to a low degree of belief, imprecise, or even counter-intuitive outcomes. To address this issue, this paper presents a method based on the best-worst method (BWM) for dealing with conflicting IBSs, which can examine the rationality of the assigned weights through a consistency factor to achieve better fusion results. Our method incorporates the interval-valued belief structure into a triangular fuzzy number (TFN) structure and assesses it through fuzzy BWM. The data model is processed by BWM, and each set of IBS is evaluated by the best and worst indicators to obtain the corresponding weights, which reduces the number of comparisons and weakens the impact of conflicting data in the comparison process. Some examples are provided to show that the proposed method performs outstandingly in conflict management.
